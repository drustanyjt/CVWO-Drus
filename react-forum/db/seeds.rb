# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# 1.times do |i|
#     Discussion.create([{
#         title: "Discussion ##{i + 1}",
#         author: "Johnny #{i + 1}",
#         body: "I have a bunch of text for you to read",
#     }])
# end
# User.create([{
#     name: "Anon"
# }])
# 5.times do |j|
#     Comment.create([{
#         text: "Comment ##{j + 1}",
#         user_id: 1, 
#         discussion_id: 10,
